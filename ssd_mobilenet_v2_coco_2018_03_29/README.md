# Object Detection using ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29 model

An object detection implementation using mobilenet model trained on coco dataset. The already trained model can be downloaded from [here][1].

To make it work, you will need the tensorflow research models from [here][2]. Follow the installation [procedure][3] before continue.

```This model requires Tensorflow >= 1.5.0. So, it is better to use a virtualenv if you already have older version of Tensorflow in your core system being used by your older projects.```
