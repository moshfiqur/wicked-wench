"Give 'em a broadside! Pound 'em lads! Pound 'em!"
"We're gonna sink your stinking ship yo!"
"Take 'em below! Clear the decks, lads."

The [Wicked Wench][1] was a pirate ship which sailed in the Caribbean Sea in the early 18th century. Under the command of the notorious Pirate Captain, she attacked the Spanish port of Puerto Dorado on Isla Tesoro.

However, in this repo I have collected different computer vision algorithms with different machine learning frameworks that I implemented for work purpose or just for fun.
